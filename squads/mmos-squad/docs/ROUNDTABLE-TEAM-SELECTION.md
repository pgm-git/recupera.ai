## 📋 Expected Dialogue Patterns

### Sample Roundtable Exchange

**Pedro:** "We need to collect 12+ videos for Linus Torvalds. The current ETL can't do this. What's the solution?"

**Karpathy:** "Let's look at the data requirements. For Layer 1 (observable patterns), we need ~35 hours of video. AssemblyAI costs $0.65/hour = $23. That's within budget. The bottleneck is upload time, not transcription."

**Alan:** "But we need this to work for all minds, not just Linus. Some minds have 100+ videos. We need a configurable solution. I propose a video-transcription-service abstraction that supports AssemblyAI, Whisper, and YouTube API."

**Elon:** "Wait. First principles: Do we need 35 hours of video? What's the marginal value of video 20-35 vs just the TED talk? Maybe we're over-collecting. Ship with 5 high-value videos first, measure fidelity, then decide if we need more."

**Pedro:** "I agree with Elon. For my use case (copywriting clones), personality comes from writing, not video. But for someone like Steve Jobs, video is critical. Can we make it optional based on mind type?"

**Karpathy:** "Yes. Adaptive collection based on source availability and layer requirements. We build the pipeline, but the orchestrator decides what to collect."

**Alan:** "That's the API design insight. ETL provides capabilities (collect-video, collect-email, collect-blog). The mind-mapper task decides which capabilities to invoke based on discovery results."

---

### Conflict Resolution Example

**Disagreement:** Should we build a full LKML crawler (6-8h dev) or stick with manual sampling?

**Karpathy (Pro-Crawler):** "For production quality, we need reproducible pipelines. Manual sampling doesn't scale to 100 minds."

**Elon (Anti-Crawler):** "But we're building for Linus right now. Ship the manual solution today, abstract it later if needed. Don't build for hypothetical scale."

**Alan (Mediator):** "What if we build a lightweight email-archive-sampler that takes a query (like 'controversial threads') and fetches top N results? It's 2h dev, reusable, but not a full crawler."

**Pedro (Decision-Maker):** "That works. We can manually curate queries for high-value minds like Linus, but have automation for others. Best of both worlds."

**Resolution:** Build smart sampler (2h), not full crawler (8h).
